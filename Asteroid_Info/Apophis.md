# (99942) Apophis 

This asteroid has made headlines for its possible threat to our planet. Apophis is set to pass within 31,860 kilometers from Earth on April 13, 2029. This is not even a tenth of the distance between the Earth and the Moon (approximately 384,400 km), classifying it as a near-Earth object (NEO).

Apophis was first discovered in 2004 and countless calculations since have shown that even though it will fly by Earth again in 2036 & 2068 we will **NOT** be a risk of impact for the next hundreds of years. 

For the most recent flyby of Earth in 2029, NASA has decided to redirect OSIRIS-REx after its successful mission around Bennu (101955). The spacecraft has been re-named the OSIRIS-APophis EXplorer or OSIRIS-APEX and is set to follow Apophis on its journey across Earth's sky. The hopes are that OSIRIS-APEX will be able to utilize onboard thrusters to study what may lie beneath the asteroid's surface. This could shed light on the formation of our solar system as it holds secrets from roughly 4.6 billion years ago.
